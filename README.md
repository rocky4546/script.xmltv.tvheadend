# script.xmltv.tvheadend
This repository contains the instructions and files to use zap2it.com to produce and maintain a tv guide within tvheadend which can be integrated with Kodi.<p>
The scripts here can convert any xmltv.xml file to comply with tvheadend genre requirements; such as, schedule direct and zap2it although special instructions on how to use zap2it scripts are provided.<p>
Requirements and installation instructions can be found on the Wiki<p>
The scripts are written in bash and perl, and are assumed to run under a Linux OS.<p>
You can change the genre translations if you are not getting the correct conversions between when the tvguide says and tvheadend needs. The translation table is found in the xmltv/category-filter.pl file
