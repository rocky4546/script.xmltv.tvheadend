# script.xmltv.tvheadend
This repository contains the instructions and files to use zap2it.com to produce and maintain a tv guide within tvheadend that can be integrated with Kodi. It tries to validate your setup and automate the installation to the extent possible on Debian operating systems.  zap2xml.pl is used from http://zap2xml.awardspace.info to scrape and generate the initial xmltv.xml file from zap2it.com, so any impacts do to changes on the zap2it.com website are managed by http://zap2xml.awardspace.info.<p>
The xmltv/category-filter.pl perl script is generic and converts any xmltv.xml file to comply with tvheadend genre requirements; such as, schedule direct and zap2it although special instructions on how to use zap2it scripts are provided here.<p>
Additional requirements and installation instructions can be found on the Wiki.  All scripts are written in bash and perl, and are assumed to run under a Linux OS.<p>
You can change the genre translations if you are not getting the correct conversions between what the tvguide says and tvheadend needs. The translation table is found in the xmltv/category-filter.pl file.
